I lost my Quake 1 lit screenshots.

Note the blockiness of the shadow on the left. This could be fixed by implementing quadtrees for patches on the surfaces, subdividing down in areas where there is high constrast.

(its probably better to just subdivide the original polygons than do a 2d quad tree on the surfaces)..
